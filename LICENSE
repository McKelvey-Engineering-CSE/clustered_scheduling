Preamble:

This software is designed to allow users to execute real-time workloads, as well
as be a research platform for those who work on real-time systems. By nature,
such projects typically require large institutional investment by companies or
governments. Our goal is that this software will be useful to such users, either
as an example of a real-time parallel execution platform or as a starting point
for them to build their own. 

We want businesses and individuals to be able to use these files with no
restriction, including for commercial products. We place no requirement on
users to distribute source code with products, and we give you the right to
relicense and redistribute our code at will. You may not, however,
missappropriate our copyright, such as by attempting to copyright it or by
claiming authorship of our code. You may not take any action that would prevent
our code from being used in an open source development model. You do not need
to inform anyone you are using our software, but we would appreciate you letting
us know through the CONTACT section of the README file.
